            <p>Clusters are generated based on neighboring words in vector space—words that are used in similar contexts will be clustered together. Each column represents a different cluster, randomly selected from 150 total clusters; the words in the list are those closest to the center of the cluster.</p>
            <p>Use the dropdown on the left to select which model you want to view. Click the “Download” button to download the set of clusters you are viewing. You can also hit the “reset clusters” button to see a new set of clusters and use the slider to see more terms from each cluster. (Note that adjusting the number of terms per cluster will also reset the clusters.)</p>
            <p>
              If you click on any individual term, a new page will take you to the Women Writers Online interface (subscription required; see
