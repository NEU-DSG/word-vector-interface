          <p>Addition allows you to add the contexts associated with two terms to 
            each other, while subtraction allows you to subtract the contexts 
            associated with one word from another. To see how these work, try 
            “orange” + “red” and “orange” - “red” and compare the results.</p>
          <p>The analogies operation allows you to subtract the contexts associated 
            with one term from another, and then add the contexts associated with a 
            third term. For example, you might subtract “man” from “woman” to get a 
            vector associated with the contexts of “woman” as distinct from “man”; 
            then, adding the vector for “king” will bring in its contexts to give 
            you words associated with the distinction between woman and man 
            <strong>and</strong> with royalty; in many models, this will be “queen.” 
            Or, put more simply: woman - man + king = queen; woman is to man as 
            queen is to king.</p>
          <p>The advanced option allows you to create a query of your own using 
            multiple operations.</p>
          <p>If you click on any individual term, a new page will take you to the 
            Women Writers Online interface (subscription required; see

            search for your term in the WWO collection.
