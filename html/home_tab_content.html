          <p>To get started, type a word in the “Query term” box. The results that 
            appear are the words that are closest to the term that you queried in 
            vector space—that is, words that appear in similar contexts in the 
            corpus used to train your model.</p>
          <p>On the left-hand sidebar, you can select different models to query; you 
            can also increase the number of words in your results set. More ways to 
            explore these models can be accessed under the “Compare,” “Clusters,” 
            “Operations,” and “Visualization” tabs above.</p>
          <p>If you click on any individual term, a new page will take you to the 
            Women Writers Online interface (subscription required; see our
            <a href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/wwo/license/" target="_blank"
            >licensing page</a> for information on subscribing and setting up a free 
            trial) to search for your term in the WWO collection.
          </p>
          <p>If the query term that you select is not in the vocabulary of your chosen model, the word list generated will be a list of stop and filler words.</p>
